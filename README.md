# MDPDSimulationCode
Dissipative particle dynamics refers to a particlebased numerical method in which the dynamicsof particles that interact through conservative, dissipative, and random forces are computed. The method is coarse-grained molecular dynamicsand has the ability to capture flow at mesoscopic scales,i.e., those scales that lie between microscopic and macroscopic ones. Â 

The code use dissipative particle dynamics to simulate flow problems. The initial coordinates of wall and fluid were generated by "./PreProcess/PreProcess.f90.f90" and stored in file "initdpd.cnf"
