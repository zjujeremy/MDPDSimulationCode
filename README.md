# MDPDSimulationCode
Dissipative particle dynamics refers to a particlebased numerical method in which the dynamics of particles that interact through conservative, dissipative, and random forces are computed. The method is coarse-grained molecular dynamics and has the ability to capture flow at mesoscopic scales, i.e., those scales that lie between micro-scopic and macro-scopic ones. Â 

The code use dissipative particle dynamics to simulate flow problems. The initial coordinates of wall and fluid were generated by "PreProcess" and stored in file "initdpd.cnf".
